Description: Implements the stabilized IPTW estimators for causal effects in  
    the presence of interference as introduced by Liu, Hudgens, and 
    Becker-Dreps (2016) Biometrika. These estimators are the Hajek-like analogue
    to the Horvitz-Thompson like estimators in Tchetgen Tchetgen and VanderWeele
    (2012) SMMR and Perez-Heydrich et al. (2014) Biometrics.
