# stabilizedinterference

The goal of stabilizedinterference is to estimate causal effects in the presence of interference, with "stabilized" IPTW estimators as introduced in [Liu, Hudgens, and Becker-Dreps (2016) Biometrika](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/103/4/829/2659035). 

These estimators estimate causal effects in the presence of *partial* or *clustered* interference, with estimates of the asymptotic variance from standard M-estimation theory. 

This package is in working order, but currently under development.
